# Next.js Portfolio Project

This is a modern web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to showcase my skills in React, TypeScript, and frontend development. The project was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- **React 19 & Next.js 15**: Latest technologies for fast and scalable web apps.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **PostCSS**: CSS transformations and optimizations.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all devices.
- **Easy Customization**: Modular structure for adding new features.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The app supports hot-reloading for instant feedback.

## Folder Structure

- `src/` – Application source code
- `public/` – Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- `.next/` – Build output (generated automatically)
- `package.json` – Project dependencies and scripts

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **PostCSS**
- **ESLint**

## Deployment

Deploy easily on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), the creators of Next.js.

See the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
